The traditional sized Battleship, in some variations it can use a "Heavy Artillery" ability and select a X pattern of 5 grid positions.

> Keeping v1.0 simple, we will only implement the 1 shot per turn.

>>>>>>> c23e7d2f9e998f4749a98aab28dbf0bf423fd355

Size: 5

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Carrier in this game has been shrunk by 1 (Traditionally 6), in some variations it can "scan" or "search" a small section of the enemies grid.
(Thus revealing the enemy ship positions in that small section)
=======
Health: 4 (Size 4)
>>>>>>> c23e7d2f9e998f4749a98aab28dbf0bf423fd355

> Keeping v1.0 simple, this won't be implemented till a later version.

## Submarine

Size: 3

The traditional sized Submarine, in some variations it can fire a shot which moves up an entire row hiting only 1 ship but moves upward if it,
missed. (Thus if any ship is in that row it will hit it)

<<<<<<< HEAD
> Keeping v1.0 simple, this won't be implemented till a later version.

Also in some variations the submarine can also relocate or move to a different position. (That is it can move completely to a new position or simply rotate)

> Obviously because of such power it normally is limited to say 1 movement per game, keeping v1.0 simple, this won't be implemented till a later version if voted on.
> (See Issue [#1 [Feature] Should we implemenet the Submarines ability to relocate/move?](https://github.com/Beanzilla/BattleshipMT/issues/1))
=======
Health: 2 (Size 2)

Shots per turn: 1-2 (40% chance to get 2 shots)

Ability: Relocate (Cooldown 6 turns, Limited to 3 times per game)
>>>>>>> c23e7d2f9e998f4749a98aab28dbf0bf423fd355

## PT Boat

Size: 2

<<<<<<< HEAD
The PT Boat or Patrol Boat in this game has been expanded by 1 (Traditionally 1), due to it's traditionally very small size it normally is the hardest
ship to destroy.
=======
The phrase "Run silent, Run deep" never can be so deadly. While Subs are less durable than any other ship it remains the most deadly.

## PT Boat (Assault)

Health: 2 (Size 2)

Shots per turn: 1-2 (25% chance to get 2 shots)

Abillity: Torpedo Strike (Cooldown 8 turns, Limited to 2 times per game)

This small boat holds some of the most deadly arsenals. A Machine gun in the front and torpeados makes it a fierce ship to deal with.
