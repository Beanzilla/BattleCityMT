# BattleshipMT > Ship Specs

Semi-Traditional,

Each player gets only 1 shot per turn, regardless of number of ships not sunk.

## Battleship

Size: 5

The traditional sized Battleship, in some variations it can use a "Heavy Artillery" ability and select a X pattern of 5 grid positions.

> Keeping v1.0 simple, we will only implement the 1 shot per turn.

## Destroyer

Size: 3

The traditional sized Destroyer, in some variations it can get an extra shot.

## Aircraft Carrier

Size: 5

The Carrier in this game has been shrunk by 1 (Traditionally 6), in some variations it can "scan" or "search" a small section of the enemies grid.
(Thus revealing the enemy ship positions in that small section)

> Keeping v1.0 simple, this won't be implemented till a later version.

## Submarine

Size: 3

The traditional sized Submarine, in some variations it can fire a shot which moves up an entire row hiting only 1 ship but moves upward if it,
missed. (Thus if any ship is in that row it will hit it)

> Keeping v1.0 simple, this won't be implemented till a later version.

Also in some variations the submarine can also relocate or move to a different position. (That is it can move completely to a new position or simply rotate)

> Obviously because of such power it normally is limited to say 1 movement per game, keeping v1.0 simple, this won't be implemented till a later version if voted on.
> (See Issue [#1 [Feature] Should we implemenet the Submarines ability to relocate/move?](https://github.com/Beanzilla/BattleshipMT/issues/1))

## PT Boat

Size: 2

The PT Boat or Patrol Boat in this game has been expanded by 1 (Traditionally 1), due to it's traditionally very small size it normally is the hardest
ship to destroy.
